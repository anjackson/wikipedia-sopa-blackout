Wikipedia SOPA Blackout Web Archives
====================================

This repository contains web archives of the English (British) Wikipedia homepage during and after the SOPA Blackout.

* wikipedia-blackout contains the homepage from during the blackout.
* wikipedia-post-blackout contains the wikipedia homepage (Main Page) and the post-SOPA "thank you" page.

Each page is stored as a separate WARC archive, as collected using the wget-warc version of wget created by @ArchiveTeam.

Note that PhantomJS was used to render the pages and capture all dependencies. Also, be aware that, due to the way the blackout was implemented, the playback will only work via proxy/memento and if you are based in the UK.
